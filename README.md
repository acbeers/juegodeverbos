# Juego de los Verbos

This is a quick single-page app for a Spanish language game. Random words are
presented with a requested verb tense and person (e.g. 2nd person singular,
etc.), and users are invited to enter the correct response.

It runs entirely in the browser. To run locally, just clone the repository and
`npm run start`.

Data for the verbs is generated by the scraper in `scraper.py`, whose output
should be moved into the `public` folder.
